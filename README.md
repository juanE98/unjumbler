CSSE2310 Assignement 1 

The aim of this assignment is to create a program (called unjumble) which searches a dictionary of words to find words that can be made
from a given collection (jumble) of letters. For example, you might use such a program to find all the words
that can be made out of the letters ‘aeebcddh’, or perhaps just the longest word(s) (‘beached’ in this case, if
the program is searching a standard English dictionary). 

it accepts command line arguments as follows: ./unjumble [-alpha|-len|-longest] [-include letter ] letters [dictionary ]
